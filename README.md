# OLC-Riichi-Mahjong

Upon completion, it will use OLC 2.0 to render a game of Riichi Mahjong to the screen. Upon being workable with CPU players, locally-hosted server play will be doable.

# Libraries used

My software uses the following low-profile open-source packages to achieve its ends:

- [olcPixelGameEngine 2.15](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)
  - Used for drawing everything, frame controls, and allowing me to focus on game logic. The creator's got a great series of YouTube videos that explain how to do it, too -- check out the wiki on the page if you want to use it yourself!
- [riichi-mahjong-tiles](https://github.com/FluffyStuff/riichi-mahjong-tiles)
  - I have no actual art skills, so the fact that someone already made vector images of the exact set of tiles that I needed _in multiple palettes_ is a tremendous boon to me.

# License

Please read those so that you understand the terms and conditions by which my software is intended to be used.
